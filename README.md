# Java project
## In this repository you can find a small Java project that uses Swing to create the GUI component and a local database that stores some basic data.
## The project overall stores the first name, last name and date birth of a person. There are implemented basic DB functionalities (add, delete, replace) and some more complex functionalities (sort in alphabetical order, show only people that are above 18 years old and search for all poeple that are named a certain way).
## There is short documentation that shows pieces of code and the actual GUI of the window.
